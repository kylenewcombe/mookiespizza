    <p class="aup">Mookie's Pizza was the brainchild of the <a class="aup" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkTozjCJYn9xxTYRUXiHqPg">Oh Great Mookie Slayer</a>, also known as the Official Mookie. He's an established entertainment personality, resident philosopher, mind reader, food genius, noted astronomer, tech developer, physician, political powerhouse, Nobel Prize winner, legendary memelord, inventor of the dab, and lifelong Toronto sports fan. Nearing the end of his illustrious YouTube and entertainment career, he decided to create Mookie's Pizza to help share the heavenly goodness that is pizza with the world. Mookie's Pizza currently has 11 locations around the GTA, including their brand new head office in Toronto. Mookie strongly believes that a quality product and customer service can make or break a business, so as per Mookie's strong beliefs in natural food, we only serve homemade pizza dough and sauce, with organic toppings sourced from Canadian farmers. All of our employees have passed an extensive background check and personality test, to make sure that dealing with our staff is a pleasant experience. Our drivers are as fast as possible without breaking the law, and we even have solar ovens in our delivery cars (Bugattis) to make sure your food is hot to the touch once delivered to you. You even get a complementary fish meme from our business partner Rhys. Now that's dedication. </p>
